# Coin Change Problem Visualizer

A dynamic visualization tool for understanding the **Coin Change Problem** - a classic algorithmic challenge. This interactive visualizer demonstrates two different approaches: **Dynamic Programming** and **Knapsack-based solutions**, showing how each algorithm solves the problem of making change for a given amount using the minimum number of coins.

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Overview

The Coin Change Problem asks: *Given a set of coin denominations and a target amount, what is the minimum number of coins needed to make that amount?*

For example:
- **Coins**: [1, 5, 10, 25]
- **Amount**: 30
- **Answer**: 2 coins (25 + 5)

## âœ¨ Features
